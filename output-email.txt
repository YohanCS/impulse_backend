Hi Yehonatan,



Thank you for taking the time to visit us and participating in our 2019
Intern Hackathon. While we enjoyed meeting and learning more about you, we
had limited spots for our 2019 internships. Unfortunately, we’ve decided to
move forward with another candidate.



We wish you the best of luck and hope our paths cross again in the future.
